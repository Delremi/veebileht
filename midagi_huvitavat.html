			<ul>
				<li>Pep Guardiola (Bayern Munich's Coach) : "Busquets is the best defensive central midfielder in the world. He's tactically very strong and will only become more important for Barcelona in the future. He can follow in the footsteps of Carles Puyol and Xavi. He's very humble and calm, but doesn't mind speaking up when he sees fit either. If I was reincarnated as a player, I'd like to be like him."</li>
				<li>Vicente Del Bosque: "If I were a player, I would like to be like Busquets."</li>
				<li>Xavi: "Without Busquets, Barcelona and Spain could never had achieved what we have achieved."</li>
                <li>Andres Iniesta: "The perfect player? Falcao's ability in the air, [Carles] Puyol's personality, Xavi's right foot, [Lionel] Messi's talent and left foot, [Sergio] Busquets' tactical awareness and Cristiano's eye for goal."</li>
				<li>Pacho Maturana (Ex-Player/Coach): "For me, Sergio Busquets is the best player in the world. He never plays badly, always solves all the problems."</li>
				<li>Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid Player): "There are a number of players I like, but the one we perhaps need is Busquets."</li>
